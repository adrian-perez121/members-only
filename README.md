## First Thoughts

I think I have the rails basics down. Now it's time to focus on learning authentication.

## Final Thoughts

Using Authentication was tricky at first. There was a lot I thought to code up but it turns out Devise
did a lot of the work for me. It was refreshing but also scary to have so much happen with so little code.
There is also alot more to learn about Devise that is worrying. However, with time and practice this fear will
dissipate.
